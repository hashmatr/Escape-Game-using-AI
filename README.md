# AI-Powered Escape Room Game

## Overview
This project is an **AI-powered escape room game** developed using **Python and Pygame**. The game features AI-controlled enemies, player navigation, and procedural level parsing. The AI uses **A* search and BFS** for movement and decision-making.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Navigation**
  - Uses **A* search** for pathfinding
  - Implements **BFS for enemy movement**
  - Dynamic enemy behavior and avoidance strategies

- **Interactive Gameplay**
  - Player can collect keys to unlock doors
  - Enemies patrol and chase the player
  - Hazards like spikes cause level resets

- **Procedural Level Parsing**
  - Reads levels from JSON files
  - Loads and scales tile-based graphics
  - Supports multiple levels

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Game Engine:** Pygame
- **Algorithms Implemented:**
  - **A* Search** for pathfinding
  - **BFS for enemy AI movement**
  - **Collision Detection & Path Planning**
